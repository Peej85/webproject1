    <h1>Graphite sketches</h1>
    <br>
    <h2>This page is dedicated to graphite sketches, eventually i will add charcoal to this section as the techniques and outcomes are 'similar' (one is messier than the other!!) but for now, as i havent made any charcoal sketches, I'll just focus on graphite here!</h2>

            <h3 class ="left">Golden Eagle</h3>
        <p class="left"> Here it is, my first attempt, It's a bit rough but I was so happy with this!!<br>It looks like a bird at least!</p>

        <p class="large2"><img src="vulturecrop.jpg" alt="Sketch of black vulture"></p>
            <h4 class="right">Black Vulture</h4>
        <p class="right"> My sister went to a bird sanctuary and fell in love with Black vultures, even though the head skin looks like elbow skin! nevertheless this was my next inspiration.</p>

            <h3 class="left">Red Deer Stag</h3>
        <p class="left"> Ithought i would try a different subject matter, mainly to try out different effects, but actually, i love Deer stags, especially during rutting season!</p>

            <h4 class="right">Brown Trout</h4>
        <p class= "right"> Not the most exciting of fish, but they do have their charm. This is the first "scene" image, in my other attampts i have focused purely on drawing just a single subject matter without backgrounds(or much of one). maybe i shouldn't have started with an underwater image, and you may be asking, why brown trout? Well! my Dad asked me to draw him some, and that's all there is to it!</p>
